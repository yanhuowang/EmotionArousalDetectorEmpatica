# EmpaticaDemo
This app is designed to view and visualize EDA value in real time using Empatica E4 wristband that measures the changes in the sweating level at the skin surface besides other features. The first phase of the application defines the baseline of the EDA values of the user for a specific period of time while the user is at rest condition with the absence of any external stimuli. In other words, it finds the range of the EDA values (min and max) to be used as a threshold in the next phase of the application for detecting emotional arousal based on real time EDA values. Besides showing the values, the application provides a visualization (emoji face) which reflects the changes in the EDA values, it gets bigger when the EDA increases and smaller when it decreases. If the value ever goes above the maximum value that was previously defined, there will be a color change in the background indicating arousal.
